Hi Eino.
 

This is Javier from SOMA.
Thank you for your time today at the office. It was an interesting chat and, to follow up, 
I would like to ask you to complete the following technical exercises.

Please use Javascript language to complete them, but feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you may want to.  
And please, think of these exercises as features we may need to include on our platform and deploy to production:


Exercise 1: Palindrome challenge
Given a string, print out true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not.
Include spaces and punctuation in deciding if the string is a palindrome.

Examples:####Poista random merkit?
palindrome('rotator')  // true
palindrome('chair')  // false


Exercise 2: Anagram challenge
Write a function that checks if two provided strings are anagrams of each other; 
letter casing shouldn’t matter. Also, consider only characters, not spaces or punctuation.

Examples:
anagram('Friend', 'finder')  // true
anagram('foo', 'bar') // false
 

It would be great if you could share the code through Github or Bitbucket, or send it back to us as zip file, if not too big bundle file.


Thanks again.
BR,
Javier Ochoa
